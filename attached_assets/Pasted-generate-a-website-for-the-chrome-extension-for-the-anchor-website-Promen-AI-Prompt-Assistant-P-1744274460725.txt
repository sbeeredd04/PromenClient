# Promen - AI Prompt Assistant
Promen is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your productivity and creativity when working with AI tools. It provides a seamless way to interact with text fields across the web, offering AI-powered assistance right at your fingertips.

## Why Promen?
In the near future, the only bridge that will connect humans with AI tools is the prompt. Promen aims to be at the forefront of this transformation by providing a powerful and intuitive interface for crafting and refining prompts. By enhancing the way you interact with AI, Promen empowers you to unlock the full potential of these tools, making your interactions more efficient and effective.

## What is Promen?
Promen is an AI Prompt Assistant that integrates directly into your browser, offering real-time enhancements and suggestions for text inputs. Whether you're drafting an email, writing a blog post, or coding, Promen provides intelligent suggestions to improve clarity, conciseness, and overall quality.

## How Does It Work?
Promen integrates seamlessly into your workflow:

Floating Icon: Automatically detects text fields on web pages and displays a discrete icon. Clicking this icon opens the Promen action popup.
Enhance Prompt (Ctrl+Shift+L / Cmd+Shift+L): Takes your current prompt and expands upon it, adding detail, context, and specificity to make it more effective for AI models.
Rephrase Prompt (Ctrl+Shift+K / Cmd+Shift+K): Rewrites your prompt to be clearer, more concise, and precise, improving its overall quality and effectiveness.
Agent (Coming Soon - Ctrl+Shift+U / Cmd+Shift+U): This feature will allow you to interact with an AI agent directly within the text field. You'll be able to give it instructions or ask questions, and the agent will generate responses or modify the text in place, acting as an intelligent assistant for various tasks.
